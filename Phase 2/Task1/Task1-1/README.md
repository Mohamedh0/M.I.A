1) First I start to load the record and check if Stereo and conversion it to Mono
2) Plot the Frequency and Time domain and I observed
    - In the Time domain The waveform appears as a solid blue block with little discernible structure. This suggests either extreme noise dominating the signal or a rendering issue.
    - In the Frequency domain The high magnitude at low frequencies suggests the noise is concentrated in the lower frequency range.
    - Spectrogram locates the range of the noise.
3) I used Notch Filter and detected the buzz candidates and apply Notch
4) Plot again and at the end play the record with kind of clear sound the secert word is 313.
